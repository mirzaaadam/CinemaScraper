This is the cinemscraper application, created by Aadam Mirza for the AggieWorks application
This project was done in React, CSS, and HTML, and created using npx create-react-app, and all of the code lies within the source folder.
It queries the Open Movie Database API to return data such as cast, plot, and title of a movie and populates a webpage with a list of these details
This project can be run with npm-start. I'm still new to React, so apologies if there are any better ways to run it that I'm unaware of.
